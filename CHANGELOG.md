:rotating_light: **BREAKING CHANGE**

* Add support for the user principal [#16](https://github.com/thinkinglabs/aws-iam-policy/issues/16)

  Replaces `ArnPrincipal` used for IAM users with ARN `arn:aws:iam::123456789000:user/aPath/aUser`.

  Serialising `ArnPrincipal` will still produce a valid AWS principal JSON `{"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789000:user/aPath/aUser"}`.

  Deserialising an AWS principal `{ "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789000:user/aPath/aUser" }` will now produce a `UserPrincipal` instead of an `ArnPrincipal`.
